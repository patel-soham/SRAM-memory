# SRAM Memory using Verilog
A project to implement simple SRAM synchronous positive edge memory.
- ‚óè	Developed a testbench to verify functioning of the design and used Modelsim software for compilation and simulation.
- Performed various test cases with frontdoor access and backdoor access along with random read write tests.
